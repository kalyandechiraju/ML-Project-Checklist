        "  * Unless there are very few hyperparameter values to explore, prefer random search over grid search. If training is very long, you may prefer a Bayesian optimization approach (e.g., using gaussian process priors, as described by Jasper Snoek, Hugo Larochelle and Ryan Adams (https://goo.gl/PEFfGr)).\n",
        "2. Try Ensemble methods. Combining your best models will often perform better than running them individually.\n",
